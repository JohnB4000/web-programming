Repository for F28WP Web Programming

## Week 1
The task was to redesign the zen garden website. This was an optional task for people who had not done much HTML/CSS before. I have copied the code into my repository. However I wasn't able to redesign it as I ran out of time and was busy for the rest of the week. Also I already have good knowledge of HTML/CSS so didn't mind missing out on that task.

## Week 2
Exercises for this week are hosted on my GitHub Pages [JohnB4000.github.io](JohnB4000.github.io) and are copied here. The task was to play around with GitHub Pages which I was able to do.

## Week 3
This week was experimenting with JavaScript Scripts hosted via CDNJS. I have included the cookie banner, mermaid, leaflet and tailwind. There are many other scripts on CDNJS so may return and set up a couple more. I also branched this week to overhaul the code as the example provided in the lab sheet used pure JS to load and use the script whereas it made more sense to import the scripts in the HTML directly and only use JS file with setting up the leaflet where it required it. I also tried out an example of form validation from the slides.

## Week 4
This week's tasks are related to JQuery, AJAX & JSON. I completed the lab task which was using XMLHttpRequest(), $.ajax, load and fetch to play around with fetching XML and JSON over the web. I also played around with JQuery to gain a better understanding of it.

## Week 5
This week is about XML and RSS. The task was to play around with RSS feeds and parse the XML response. I've used two RSS feeds so far Fox News from the example and New York Times and parsed the response into the HTML. I also decided to make an improved version that is seperate. It has two buttons that select the source either Fox News or New York Times and it then fades in replacing the previous stories. I used JQuery to implement the RSS parser instead of pure JS like the example. I also styled the website making the articles appear in a grid layout with 4 stories to a row to make it easier to read. I also extended the articles so it displays the attached image if it exists.
